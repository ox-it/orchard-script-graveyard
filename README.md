# orchard-script-graveyard
A collection of scripts that are no longer in production for the University of Oxford's Orchard Mac management team, here for reference if anyone will find them useful!

## Java_Web_Plugin_Control
We used to manage whether users could use the Java web plugin at all by moving it to/from a disabled folder in /Library/Internet Plug-ins and then had a master switch to enable/disable it for users who were allowed to use it that could be run from JAMF Self Service. With NPAPI on the whole being deprecated and the plug in being disabled as a matter of course in browsers now, we decided to deprecate this.
